                    <p>Plumbing contractors are often the first to arrive at a project and the last to leave. Sagamore realizes this, and works diligently to set a standard for others to follow. It's a "professional" approach to a blue-collar industry that sets us apart from the others.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From the beginning, Sagamore's planners and estimators pride themselves on accuracy while looking for ways to reduce project costs for owners and developers. Our CAD team takes this further by optimizing coordination and off-site fabrication—reducing the number of bodies on a general contractor's site. In the field, plumbers who have benefited from a comprehensive in-house job and safety training are qualified for every aspect of construction plumbing—including plumbing for medical, laboratory and biohazard gases and fluids. We self-perform all plumbing functions to maximize quality control.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The totality of these efforts are summarized by our core principles: Client satisfaction and quality craftsmanship.</p>

                    <p>The key to the success of Sagamore's construction HVAC team lies in a combination of outstanding talent, collective experience, cutting-edge techniques, and ample resources.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Sagamore has been fortunate enough to have been selected to conduct HVAC installations for some of the best corporations and institutions in their fields: from major hospitals to respected cancer centers, from secure biosafety laboratories to clean research facilities, from some of the largest universities and high schools in New England to select secondary academies, from automobile dealers and cinema complexes to massive "full-experience" retail stores.

                    <br>
                    Sagamore frames our work approach to reflect our customers' needs. Our customers know they are working with a sub who understands that our work affects the health and productivity of the building occupants—and who actively assists in exploring the best ways to ensure a building's HVAC system is the right one, installed the right way.</p>

                    <br>
                    Sagamore's service department has the capability to take over partial or full maintenance and operational responsibilities for schools, hospitals and shopping malls—or simply to be on-call for any business, including small ones. Our service department can custom-design a cost-efficient program that fits your organization's unique needs.

                   <br>
                   <br>
                   Sagamore's plumbers are the best trained in New England, thanks to a company-mandated continuing education and safety program at our own Sagamore Academy. Just maintaining a current license isn't enough—our team needs to be the best of the best.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   In addition to traditional plumbing capabilities, Sagamore's commercial service plumbers are qualified and proficient in gas plumbing as well as non-traditional fluid control including biohazards. We are comfortable working with all materials, including stainless steel.</p>

                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                
                <p>In 1991 Joe Harold set up a small plumbing shop in the 400-square-foot basement of a small office building in Sagamore Beach, Massachusetts. Even with just two employees, the mission was the same as today: an unyielding commitment to customer satisfaction and to job quality.
                <br>
                <br>
                Commercial and industrial plumbing was the young company's strength—especially in the construction field. As more and more contractors gained trust in Sagamore, the company moved to Weymouth in 1994 and added residential and light commercial plumbing and HVAC to its services. Soon after Sagamore developed a reputation for proficiency in plumbing for medical and laboratory gases.
                <br>
                <br>
                After 18 years of steady growth, Sagamore today is a diversified plumbing and HVAC company employing a staff of over 150 individuals serving contractors and businesses as a dedicated team. The company now operates out of a 25,000-square-foot facility with a full-time fabrication shop, a dedicated staff training center and a fleet of over 35 vehicles.</p>
